In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't being written to Firestore correctly despite no apparent errors in the code. The `set()` method appeared to execute without throwing exceptions, but the data wasn't reflecting in the database.  This was intermittent, occurring only on certain devices and under specific conditions.  The code used standard Firebase Admin SDK methods.
