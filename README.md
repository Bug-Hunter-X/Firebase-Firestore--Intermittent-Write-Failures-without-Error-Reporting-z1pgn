This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Firebase Firestore where data writes fail intermittently without throwing any errors. The bug is observed using the Firebase Admin SDK in a Node.js environment. The `firestoreBug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `firestoreBugSolution.js` provides a solution that addresses this issue. The root cause appears to be related to network instability or temporary server-side issues within Firebase. The solution involves adding robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure data persistence even under unreliable network conditions.
